Plant Disease Recognition System Using CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to identify plant diseases from leaf images and provides tailored treatment recommendations. Built with EfficientNetB0 for optimal accuracy, the system offers a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction. If there are any inquiries, just contact me thru my email amirmstqm412@gmail.com. This project was built for my college's Final Year Project. Since I am still an amateur, so there might be any unnecessaries line of code in the project. I hope you can read and understand the README.txt file first before starting this project. Happy coding nerdies(JK) :p

1. Run requirement.txt

    pip install -r requirement.txt

2. Run the app.py by using CMD (for windows), CD to the GreenGuardian folder and run :

    python app.py

3. To use prediction function in recdisease.html, you can use the test sample in the test sample folder, or you can download your own leaf
   image.

4. To access the feedback function with your own email, go to https://web3forms.com/#start and Create access key by entering your own email.
   The public access key will be send trough your email. Once you get your own access key, go to line number 29 in feedback.html, and paste
   your own access key in value="".

5. If you want to download the dataset, download it from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazeldsokyx/plantvillage/data

6. I run the notebook in Google Colab, if the ram or GPU full during the runtime, you might need to purchase Pro version of Google Colab
