Plant Disease Recognition System Using CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to identify plant diseases from leaf images and provides tailored treatment recommendations. Built with EfficientNetB0 for optimal accuracy, the system offers a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction. For the model, so far the only model that can recognize all the classes correctly is EfficientNetB0. You can also try to run the other notebook and improve the existing algorithm. This project was built for my college's Final Year Project. Since I am new to github and still an amateur coder, so there might be any unnecessaries line of code in the project. I hope you can read and understand the README.txt file first before starting this project. Happy coding nerdies(JK) :p
